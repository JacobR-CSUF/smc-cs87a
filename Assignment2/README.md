When run, the program must take four numbers (can be ints or floats) as input from the terminal. The program takes each number one at a time, displaying a prompt for each number it requests. For example, when the program is run, it may print the following to the terminal:
```
Please enter the first number:
```
Thus, after we provide an actual input (let's say 18), the terminal would appear as follows:
```
Please enter the first number: 18
Please enter the second number:
```
The user has provided an input of 18 for the first number, and the program is currently waiting for a second input.

The example above is just to give you an idea; it only handles two numbers, your program must handle four.
You may assume the input will always be a valid integer or float, you do not have to handle incorrect inputs.

After receiving four numbers, your program must then print the following values:
- The sum of the four numbers
- The average of the four numbers
- The square of each number, in the same order they were provided (each on a separate line)

**All printed numbers must be floats, even if the inputs could be integers.**  

Below is an example of what your program output should look like:
